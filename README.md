# Scheduling and Optimization System

## Overview
This system is designed to tackle complex scheduling and optimization problems using advanced algorithms and adaptive techniques. The primary goal is to efficiently allocate resources, optimize scheduling, and ensure constraint satisfaction.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Used to optimize the scheduling process by simulating natural selection, enabling efficient exploration of potential solutions.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Employed for generating initial schedules quickly, providing a solid foundation for further refinement.
- **Constraint Programming**: Ensures that schedules comply with specific hard and soft constraints.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continually refines schedules over multiple generations based on user feedback and performance metrics.
- **Flexible User Input**: Allows users to configure constraints and parameters for customized scheduling solutions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **PyQt5**: GUI framework for user interaction
- **Database Module**: Manages data storage and retrieval

## Installation
### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install PyQt5
```

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
4. If the database setup is not complete, the system will initialize it automatically.

## Code Structure
- `components/Database.py`: Handles database setup and validation.
- `containers/Main.py`: Contains the main application window and logic.
- `main.py`: Entry point for the application.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of machine learning for predictive scheduling.
- Enhanced visualization tools for analyzing schedule efficiency.
- Real-time updates based on external constraints.
